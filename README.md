# Google-Book-Search
-This program is a React-based Google Books Search app, it allows the user the ability to search for any book or author, as well as save a book or view a book on Google Books website.

-Google Books API returns URL's for book image, title, Author, Date Published, and a book description. 

-Once the user starts typing in the searchbar results will render in the body of the webpage. This way if the user doesn't know the exact title of the book or the author, they can still find what they are searching for. 

-mLab MongoDB dyno for remote database

-Added Polyfill for backwards compatability
